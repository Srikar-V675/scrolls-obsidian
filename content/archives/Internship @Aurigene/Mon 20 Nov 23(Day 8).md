**Internship Report**

_(Date: 20/11/23)_

**1. Introduction:**

- **Internship Title:** Aurigene Oncology ltd. (Department: Computational Chem and Informatics)
- **Tasks/Projects:**
    - BioActivity Prediction of Compounds using ML models.
    - Crystal Structure Prediction.

**2. Daily Tasks:**

- **Tasks Assigned:**
    - Train models on various train test splits to try to raise the present model's accuracy score.
    - Determine which model can be selected for production after verifying your forecasts.
    - Make a presentation containing the three models that were constructed, the outcomes, and the approach that was employed.
- **Accomplishments:**
    - Was successful in developing a model that, after some hyper parameter tweaking and different splits, provided an accuracy score of 68% higher than the prior model.
    - I validated the new predictions from the new model.
    - I prepared a presentation that includes the three models I constructed, the outcomes, and the methods I followed.
    - A few follow-ups on the programme installation with the IT department.

**3. Key Learnings:**

- **Skills/Knowledge Gained:**
    - Preparing PPT
    - Hyperparameter tuning
    - decision making
- **Insights/Discoveries:**
    - Different train test splits can sometimes give bad or good results.
    - Simple presentations that just feature the information you want to communicate should be used.

**4. Challenges Faced:**

- **Obstacles Encountered:**
    - Both the old and new models had advantages and disadvantages, so I wasn't sure which one we should take into account.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:**
    - We weighed the pros and cons and considered the model that had more pros.

**5. Next Steps:**

- **Tasks for Tomorrow:**
    - None.
- **Pending Work/Follow-up:**
    - None.

**7. Conclusion:**

- **Summary of Achievements:**
    - To find any model that performs better than the existing one, new models were built for the same dataset but with alternative train test splits. A new model with a modified split of the train test produced higher accuracy. I put up a presentation with three models I created, along with the approach, findings, and conversations.
