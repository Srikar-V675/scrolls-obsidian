**Internship Report**

_(Date: 8/11/23)_

**1. Introduction:**

- **Internship Title:** Aurigene Oncology ltd. (Department: Computational Chem and Informatics)
- **Tasks/Projects:**
    - None for now.

**2. Summary**

- Aurigene is a biotech business at the clinical stage that is dedicated to the discovery and development of innovative and potent cancer treatments. The corporation assigned me to the computational chemistry department.
- For four to five months, AI and ML has piqued my curiosity. Rather than conducting the actual experiments, which could take weeks, the computational chemistry department team is utilising machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts and models to anticipate the behaviours of various chemical and biological components.
- My mentor Ms. Shipra, to whom I was assigned today, will be working with me. She gave a brief introduction to the group and their objectives.
- After reading through a few research papers that my mentor had recommended, I decided to call it a day.Â I'm excited to dig deeper into these materials because they perfectly match my carrer objectives in the future.
