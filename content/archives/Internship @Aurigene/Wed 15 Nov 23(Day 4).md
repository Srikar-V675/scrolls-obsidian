**Internship Report**

_(Date: 15/11/23)_

**1. Introduction:**

- **Internship Title:** Aurigene Oncology ltd. (Department: Computational Chem and Informatics)
- **Tasks/Projects:**
    - BioActivity Prediction of Compounds using ML models.

**2. Daily Tasks:**

- **Tasks Assigned:**
    - To train a machine learning model that determines whether ligands are active or inactive, the NR2FG_ligands dataset was provided.
    - Select any trained model and get an accuracy score of at least 70%.
    - Provide the group leader with a copy of the classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy scores for the top three models.
    - Plot a graph in an Excel spreadsheet and validate the trained models' predicted vs. actual values.
- **Accomplishments:**
    - Used the dataset to train a variety of machine learning models, among which the Random Forest Classifier, DecionTreeClassifier, and Logistic Regression models yielded accuracy ratings of 65%, 70%, and 80%, respectively.
    - After I gave the group leader the recorded report, he recommended that I retrain the same models on a split 70:30 train test.
    - Completed validating the models and plotting the graph in excelsheet.

**3. Key Learnings:**

- **Skills/Knowledge Gained:**
    - Process of model selection
    - Hyperparameter tuning
    - Evaluating model performance(using confusion matrix and classification report)
- **Insights/Discoveries:**
    - RandomForest models work best for almost all problem statements.

**4. Challenges Faced:**

- **Obstacles Encountered:**
    - Choosing hyperparameters for better model performance
- **Problem-Solving Approach:**
    - Experimenting through various parametrs and performing Cross Validation

**5. Next Steps:**

- **Tasks for Tomorrow:**
    - Submitting the validations and plotted graph.
- **Pending Work/Follow-up:**
    - None.

6**. Conclusion:**

- **Summary of Achievements:**
    - I trained a number of machine learning models and gained knowledge in selecting models, adjusting hyperparameters, and assessing model performance.
