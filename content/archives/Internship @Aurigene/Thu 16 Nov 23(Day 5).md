**Internship Report**

_(Date: 16/11/23)_

**1. Introduction:**

- **Internship Title:** Aurigene Oncology ltd. (Department: Computational Chem and Informatics)
- **Tasks/Projects:**
    - BioActivity Prediction of Compounds using ML models.

**2. Daily Tasks:**

- **Tasks Assigned:**
    - Instead of using Rdkit as was done yesterday, train models on the same dataset using Padel descriptors.
    - Present the scores and plotted graphs of the top two trained models.
    - Using Excel, cleaning up the null values in the produced Padel descriptions.
- **Accomplishments:**
    - Figured out the difficult task of creating padel descriptors for the SMILES in the dataset.
    - Using the resulting padel descriptors, decision tree and random forest models were trained.
    - Excel was used to find the null value in the produced Padel descriptors, and sorting the dataset—which wasn't done—was also done.

**3. Key Learnings:**

- **Skills/Knowledge Gained:**
    - Acquired knowledge on producing Padel descriptors for SMILES.
    - Handling missing data using Excel.
- **Insights/Discoveries:**
    - The most common tool for basic data analysis tasks is Excel.

**4. Challenges Faced:**

- **Obstacles Encountered:**
    - Unable to figure out how to use Padel descriptors.
    - Using excel effeciently.
    - if the models based on rdkit or Padel descriptors should be dropped.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:**
    - I made reference to the code where my mentor had previously generated the Padel descriptors.
    - I was advised to abandon the models based on Padel descriptors by my tutor, and the reasoning behind that decision.

**5. Next Steps:**

- **Tasks for Tomorrow:**
    - Examine the study article on Crystal Structure Prediction and make a list of the software that has to be installed so that we may obtain the IT department's approval to do so.
- **Pending Work/Follow-up:**
    - None.

6**. Conclusion:**

- **Summary of Achievements:**
    - Figured out the SMILES Padel descriptors generation process. Trained models using the Padel descriptors; nevertheless, despite the fact that it produced high scores for us, the model was eliminated. Using excel for data cleaning.
