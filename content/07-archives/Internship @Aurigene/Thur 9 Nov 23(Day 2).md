**Internship Report**

_(Date: 9/11/23)_

**1. Introduction:**

- **Internship Title:** Aurigene Oncology ltd. (Department: Computational Chem and Informatics)
- **Tasks/Projects:**
    - Training ML models on the HLM 60 min dataset to predict "HLM %compound remaining at 60min" with at least 70% accuracy to familiarise myself with Python, machine learning models, and the department's work.

**2. Daily Tasks:**

- **Tasks Assigned:**
    - Training ML models on the HLM 60 min dataset with 70% accuracy.
    - Tuning hyper parameters to get my desired accuracy from models that are performing good.
- **Accomplishments:**
    - I was able to acquire the best results from the Random Forest Classifier model. I received a 69% accuracy rate from this model on the HLM 60 min dataset.
    - Tuned hyper parameters for a good performing model to get the 69% accuracy.

**3. Key Learnings:**

- **Skills/Knowledge Gained:**
    - Data preprocessing
    - Generating Rdkit descriptors for SMILES.
    - Hyper parameter tuning.
- **Insights/Discoveries:**
    - There is a different protocol to building ML models for predicting chemical activity/solubility.

**4. Challenges Faced:**

- **Obstacles Encountered:**
    - Generating Rdkit descriptors for the SMILES.
    - Saw a spike and drop of accuracy scores with hyper parameter tuning.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:**
    - Referred to code snippets in which the Rdkit descriptors were already researched by my mentor.
    - Decided to fix on one of the models that performed well on the classification report, confusion matrix and accuracy.

**5. Next Steps:**

- **Tasks for Tomorrow:**
    - Similar tasks to today.
    - validating the predictions produced today.
- **Pending Work/Follow-up:**
    - None.

**7. Conclusion:**

- **Summary of Achievements:**
    - Able to acquire a good result from the Random Forest Classifier Model with 69% accuracy.
    - My mentor mentioned that the accuracy was a good score.
