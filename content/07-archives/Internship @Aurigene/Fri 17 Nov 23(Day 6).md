**Internship Report**

_(Date: 17/11/23)_

**1. Introduction:**

- **Internship Title:** Aurigene Oncology ltd. (Department: Computational Chem and Informatics)
- **Tasks/Projects:**
    - BioActivity Prediction of Compounds using ML models.
    - Crystal Structure Prediction.

**2. Daily Tasks:**

- **Tasks Assigned:**
    - Examine the study article on Crystal Structure Prediction and make a list of the software that has to be installed so that we may obtain the IT department's approval to do so.
    - Raise a ticket for the problem with github access.
    - Raise a ticket to the IT department and provide the list of softwares to be installed.
- **Accomplishments:**
    - Reviewed the research paper on Crystal Structure Prediction and compiled a list of installed software for the tool.
    - Raised the ticket and got the github issue resolved.
    - Raised the ticket to the IT department for the installation of softwares.

**3. Key Learnings:**

- **Skills/Knowledge Gained:**
    - Identifying important research paper discoveries and figuring out how to apply them within the organisation.
    - Submitting tickets to the IT department so that our work can be completed.
- **Insights/Discoveries:**
    - Everything has a procedure or protocol and it is not as easy as doing it on your personal laptop.

**4. Challenges Faced:**

- **Obstacles Encountered:**
    - I did not find the chemistry sections of the study paper to be interpretable.
    - A few of the codes were also too complex for me to comprehend.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:**
    - My mentor helped me address my problems, but I always made sure to take some time to figure things out on my own before coming to her.

**5. Next Steps:**

- **Tasks for Tomorrow:**
    - Study on applying ML to automate docking and virtual ligand screening.
- **Pending Work/Follow-up:**
    - None.

**7. Conclusion:**

- **Summary of Achievements:**
    - Summarised the research paper's most important findings and created a list of the software needed to operate the tool. Raised tickets and got the problem at hand resolved.
