# Accenture Reflections
***
**Round-1:** Online Assessment
- Questions were pretty easy, some of them I just put the answer randomly.
- I couldn't get the answers of many networking & cloud Qs
- The rest went pretty well, even the pseudo code part.
- Refer to the topics to know what the sections were in [[Accenture#^eddf1f |Online Assessment]].

**Round-2:** Coding Assessment
- I got 1 idiotic Questions and 1 sliding window Question
- When I was solving the 2nd Q, I didn't read the question properly and misunderstood the Q.
- And the 2nd mistake regarding Q2 was that It didn't click that this was a sliding window.
- Even after I realised it was sliding window, the understanding of my question was wrong and I used a unnecessary hashmap and complicated it.
- When the test cases didn't pass and I read the Q again I realised I didn't need the hashmap and I had to return something else.
- Even though it was a relatively easy Q I complicated it myself.

**Round-3:** Interview Round 
- It went pretty well, I just got asked behavioural and project-based Qs.
- I think I answered pretty well, things went good.
