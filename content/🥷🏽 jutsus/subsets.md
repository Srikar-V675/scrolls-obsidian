Its all there in the name, a `subset` is a part of a whole `set`. 

> [!example]-
> `set` -> [1, 3, 5, 4, 9]
> `subset` -> [1, 5, 9]

> [!important]
> There is only one thing you need to keep in mind when it come to subsets: *At every step you have a choice to either choose an element or not to choose it*
