# Heap as Priority Queue

[[heaps implementation|heaps]] are implemented as [[arrays]], but why? So that they can be used as [[priority queue]].

From [[heaps implementation]] we know that they are implemented as a [[arrays]] because it allows for easy access of parent and children nodes. Consider a `max-heap`.

```mermaid
graph TD;
43 --> 19
43 --> 35
19 --> 12
19 --> 4
35 --> 2
35 --> 20
12 --> 6
```

**Find highest priority,**
$$O(1)$$

**Insert/Delete([[growing a heap]]/[[shrinking a heap]]**),
$$O(log\ n)$$
because of the binary tree structure of [[heaps]].

Every time we dequeue or enqueue we need to [[growing a heap]] and [[shrinking a heap]].

**Why [[heaps]] and not [[binary trees and binary search trees|binary search trees]] for [[priority queue]]?**
A: [[why not bst as priority queue]]
