## Notes
- Initially I thought [[Merge Sort]] is better than [[Quick Sort]], but when [[Arrays]] are concerned [[Quick Sort]] is better. 
- Remove redundant operations in your code **Idiot!!**.
- Make sure you test out edge cases even before you submit the code, don't keep adjusting your code every time you get a edge case wrong.
