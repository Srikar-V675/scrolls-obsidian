# Binary Trees and BSTs

### Summary
Each node except the root node in a binary tree contains: left subtree and right subtree. A searchable binary tree is a binary search tree.

**Complete Binary tree:** a binary tree in which every level, except the last is completely filled and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

**Balanced Binary tree:** a binary tree in which the left and right subtree of every node doesn't differ in height by no more than 1.

> ```python
> class Node:
> 	def __init__(self, val):
> 		self.val = val
> 		self.left = None
> 		self.right = None
> ```

### Binary Search Trees 
These [[trees]] are a special case of binary trees where each node follows a rule.

> *Rule:* left node is lesser than current node and right node is greater.

> **Space complexity of traversing a balanced binary tree would O(h), where 'h' is the height of the tree.** 
> **Space Complexity of traversing a BST would be O(log n).**
> **Space Complexity of traversing a skewed binary tree or BST would be O(n).**
