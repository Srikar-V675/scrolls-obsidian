# Heaps

Heaps is an example of a data structure that makes use of multiple concepts that we have learnt so far. 

Heaps is essentially a [[binary trees and binary search trees|binary tree]] that is supposed to follow an extra number of rules that make it a heap.

**Properties:**
1. *Shape of tree:* 
	- must be a complete binary tree. 
	- last level should always have its leftmost nodes present.
