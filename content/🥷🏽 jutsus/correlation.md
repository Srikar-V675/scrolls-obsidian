# correlation

**Source:** [[🥷🏽 jutsus/statistics.md|statistics]]

[[covariance|covariance]] only tells us `direction` of the relationship while correlation tells us both `strength` and `direction` of the relationship.

> [!NOTE]
> The values ranges from `-1` to `1`. Where, `-1` is perfectly -ve correlation and `1` is perfectly +ve correlation and `0` is no correlation.

**Formula:** $$P{xy} = \frac{cov(X, Y)}{\sigma{x}.\sigma{y}}$$
