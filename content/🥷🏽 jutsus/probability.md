# Probability

![[probability-mindmap.excalidraw.svg]]

#### Probability Theorem
Probability theorem is the framework or study that deals with uncertainty of experiments or events.

Probability is nothing but making something unsure/uncertain -> sure. For example, if we toss a coin we are `unsure` whether the outcome would be either *heads or tails* but by going with probability standards we can be sure that it's 50% sure that it can be `heads` or vice versa. 

**Sample Space:** refers to the complete set of outcomes for an experiment. 

*Tossing a coin* -> sample space would be heads and tails.

**Event:** refers to an event in an experiment.

*Tossing a coin* -> an event would be getting heads.

##### Degree of belief
- 0 -> absolutely uncertain
- 1 -> absolutely certain
