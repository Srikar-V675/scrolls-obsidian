# Two-Pointers

## Summary
- Moving 2 pointers in a array based on a condition
- Used when you want to optimise a O(n^2) time -> O(n) time and O(n) space -> O(1) space.
### Characteristics
- 2 pointers
- Easy way to decide which pointer to move
- Way to process the array

### Classifications
- **Same Direction:** The pointers move in the same direction.
- **Opposite Direction:** The pointers move in opposite direction.

### Problems...
- Palindrome
- 2Sum, 3Sum...
- Linked Lists
- Multiple Sequences (comparing sequences to find the right one)-> Longest word with condition ...
- Find 2 elements where condition...
- Problems asking for O(1) memory optimisation.

> [!info]
> **Sliding Window** problems are similar to same direction 2 pointer problems but in sliding window we compute something for the whole window and update it as we add/remove an item from the window, instead of recalculating for the whole window.
