# desexualizing your brain is the cheat code to success

[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0dAK6IQsSk&t=7)
Every single day you are frying your brain, killing attention span, killing your focus.

`Self-Discipline and Self-Control` the things without which you can't be successful, you are just fooling yourself

Step-1: Stop fucking watching p***. 

Fries up your brain which leads to the erosion of the part of brain that is responsible for emotions, motivation and actions. Your brain has been rewired to be aroused by watching others do the deed rather than yourself.

Step-2: Stop pleasuring yourself.

Cheap Dopamine. You are telling your brain that you've done what you have been evolutionary been told to do -> procreate. The brain gives a high dopamine peak due to this which makes it unable to focus or do hard work.

P*** and masturbation gives a dopamine spike of 250% which is higher than fast food or drugs.

Step-5: Focus Inward and Not Outward.

Dopamine Detox... Stop seeking cheap dopamine outwards(i.e p***, parties, food...) and start seeking it inwards(i.e delayed gratification, hard work, goals...)
