## Process

**Round-1:** Aptitude Test *28-08-2024*
- 90 mins
- **Questions:**
	- 15 MCQs - Java, OOPs, AWS, Cloud, DBMS
	- 2 Puzzle Qs - Subjective -> where you need to type the logic of your answer
	- 1 Coding Q - Don't have to pass all test cases the approach matters
- **Reflections:**
	- The **MCQs** were tough but I was able to manage. Topics: C-programming, Java, OOPs, SQL, AWS.
		- **C-programming:** Solve given code and choose the right output.
		- **Java:** Same as for C-programming Qs.
		- **OOPs:** Questions about abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance and some related to code.
		- **SQL:** There were tables given -> Qs with SQL Query and choose which can be alternate query, Qs asking for SQL query given desired output, Qs with options for queries for desired output (choose the right one)...
		- **AWS:** Simple scenario based Qs.
	- **Puzzle Qs** were subjective i.e I had to type an answer. 1st Q was logical and I answered it but 2nd Q was really tricky I typed whatever I understood and my solution to it.
		- **First Q:** There was Jonathon & James who lie constantly. Jonathan lies on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, for the rest of the week he is `honest`. James lies on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, for the rest of the week he tells the truth. What is the day of the week where both can say - "Tomorrow, I'm gonna lie."
		- **Second Q:** We have three prisoners A, B and C. They are standing in line facing forward with A in the first, B in the second and C in the last position. Hence C can see both A & B in front of him, B can see only A in front of him while A can't see anyone. The guard has 3 White hats and 2 Black hats and he puts them on A, B and C randomly without looking at the colours. The guard asks them to guess the colour of the hat with 100% certainty, if anyone one of them guess's it right then he will release all of them. C did not answer with 100% uncertainty, B also didn't answer with 100% uncertainty but A answered with 100% certainty and they were all released. Why was A right?
	- **Coding Q** -> Bad Luck. The others got simple array Qs (like find minimum in array ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) but I got a DP problem ‚ò†.
		- **Minimum Difference:** 
			- We have an array of size N which contains `1 to N natural numbers` not sorted. You have to split the array into two sets (non-contagious sets also count) such that the `difference of sum of the sets is the minimum`. 
			- **Inputs:** N and the array
			- **Outputs:** Minimum difference
			- **Example:**
				- **Input:**
				  N = 4
				  arr = [4, 2, 3, 1]
				- **Output:**
				  minDiff = 0
				- **Explanation:**
				  If you split the array (including non-contagious) into two sets: [4, 1] & [2, 3]. The sum of each of these splits is `4 + 1 = 5` and `2 + 3 = 5`. The difference of these sums is equal to `0`. Hence the output is 0.
		- I clearly couldn't solve it fully but I got the logic in and passed just one test case for the submit code and the rest I'm guessing was right but I got memory limit exceeded but not wrong answer.
