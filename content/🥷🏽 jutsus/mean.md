# Mean

It is the average of values and is used to represent the central point of `continuos` data. It tells us about the value that is most common in the data.

**Formula:**
- Sample mean: $$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$
- Population mean: $$\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i
$$

> [!note]+
> It is easily influenced by outliers and solution for this is using [[median]]
