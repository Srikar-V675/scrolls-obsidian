# quantiles

**Source:** [[measures of central tendency]]

Spliting up a sample into equal sized subgroups, allowing us to analyse the distribution of data and detect outliers.

## Types
1. [[quartiles]]
2. deciles - 10 parts
3. percentiles - 100 parts

> [!NOTE]
> percentiles are not same as `percentages` because percentiles take only the available range of numbers while percentages take the maximum that can be taken. For example, if the highest score out of 100 is 93 then percentile considers [0, 93] while percentage still considers [0, 100].
