# Uber ETA Computation

Uber uses a [[graphs]] representation of the map or the route, where the roads are the edges and the intersections are nodes. 

They partition the [[graphs]] and pre-compute the time to efficiently estimate the ETA. This partition makes it easy to compute without using the dijikstras's algo which can be expensive for a graph that can contain 100s of thousands of nodes (intersections). 

The [[graphs]] are weighted graphs that denote the traffic and distance based on the traffic, which further optimises the efficiency of ETA.
