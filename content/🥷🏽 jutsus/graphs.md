# Graphs 

## Summary
Graphs is an abstract data structure derived from mathematics, it is a set of objects (nodes or vertices) where there can be edges that connect these nodes or vertices. 

Mathematical definition of a graph:
$$
G = (V, \ E)
$$

Edges can be directed, undirected and can also have weights. [[trees]] are undirected and acyclic graphs. [[trees]] can be considered as a subset of graphs.

> "A tree will always be a graph, but not all graphs will be trees."

> [!info]-
> [[trees]] have a set of rules that need to be followed to make them a tree, while [[graphs]] don't have any of these rules, the one and only rule is there are nodes and there are edges that connect these nodes. [[graphs]] are like the pirates and [[trees]] are like the marines from the one piece world.

Graphs are used to represent relationships between objects (nodes or vertices) like social media following, distance between locations etc
