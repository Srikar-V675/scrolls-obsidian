# Permutations

A specific arrangement or ordering of elements of a set. In permutations the ==order is important== where for the set -> {a, b} the permutations would be: `[a, b] and [b, a]`.

if `n` is the number of elements in the set then the number of permutations that can be formed is: $$n!$$

> [!example]-

**Repetitions:**
`n` -> number of element 
`r` -> number of repetitions in `n` elements

*Formula:* $$\frac{n!}{r!}$$

If you want to arrange `n` elements in `k` ways then

*Formula:* $$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$
