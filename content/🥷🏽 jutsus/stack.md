# Stack

## Summary
- A stack is a abstract data type that follows `LIFO - Last In First Out`. 

### Idea
Stack literally means a stack of items. I remember in school when I used to submit books(stack of books) I always used to put my book in the middle because if mine is the last one on `top` then that book is the first one that is picked by the teacher.

> [!note]
> Operations on stack occur only in one direction i.e at the `top`. Be it `push` or a `pop`, it always happens at the top.

### Implementation

^77c198

- Just like [[Queue]], we can implement stack using [[Arrays]] or [[Linked List]].
- We have the same problems as we have for [[Queue]] implementation using [[Arrays]].
	- *Since stack can grow infinitely without any upper limit*, [[Arrays]] eventually can't find a contagious memory of that size and hence it raises a `stack overflow exception`.
	- This is what happens when we have an infinite [[Recursion]].
- In the case of a Singly [[Linked List]], we can add or remove elements from the `head node` which would always be O(1) time complexity. And we can always add a node as long as there is memory left (if not then there is a major memory problem).

### Functions
1. *push:* add element to the top of stack. 
2. *pop:* remove element from the top of stack. 
3. *top (peek):* returns the value of top but doesn't pop it.
4. *isEmpty:* check if stack is empty.
5. *size:* returns size of stack.

> [!example]
> 1. undo / redo
> 2. browser history
> 3. call stacks

> Stacks are used to implement *depth-first-search*.

### Time complexity

|Operation|Big-O|
|---|---|
|Top/Peek|O(1)|
|Push|O(1)|
|Pop|O(1)|
|isEmpty|O(1)|
|Search|O(n)|

## Key Terms
- *LIFO:*  the item that comes in first is the one to go out.
- *Stack Overflow:* an exception that occurs when the stack array can no longer find contagious memory.
