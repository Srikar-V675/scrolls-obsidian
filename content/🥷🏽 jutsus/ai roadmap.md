# ai roadmap

> [!mindset]
> There is only one way to success and that is the hard way. So if you are feeling comfortable with whatever you are doing then that just means there are 99% of other that are doing the same thing. 


# Main RoadMap Flow

- [Machine Learning Roadmap - by Ayush Singh \[ Newera \]](https://whimsical.com/machine-learning-roadmap-by-ayush-singh-newera-J1EwnqAPUtF77ejgbRc8Hk)
- [Roadmap to Learn AI in 2024. A free curriculum for hackers and… | by Benedict Neo | bitgrit Data Science Publication | Medium](https://medium.com/bitgrit-data-science-publication/a-roadmap-to-learn-ai-in-2024-cc30c6aa6e16#6e37)
- Also Consider this Course: [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/)
