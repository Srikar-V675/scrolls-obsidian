# z-score

**Source:** [[standard normal distribution]]

z-score is a value that helps us convert a [[normal distribution]] to [[standard normal distribution]]. z-score is defined as the amount of [[standard-deviation]] by which the current value is above or below the [[mean]] of the data. 

**Formula:** $$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

> [!hint]
> actual value of $$n\sigma = \mu + (n \cdot \sigma)$$
