# geometric distribution

**Source:** [[probability-distributions]]

It is the [[probability-distributions]] of [[discrete random variables]] that describes the no. of trials that is needed for the event to be a success. 

It gives us the [[probability]] of an event being successful(occurring) given the no. of trials and the [[probability]] of success.

**Formula:** $${P(X=k)=(1-p)^{k-1}\cdot p}$$
where $$p = probability\ of\ success$$ and $$k = no.\ of\ trials$$
