# Shrinking a Heap

Again follows the same properties mentioned in [[growing a heap]]. 

### Steps
1. Remove the desired node first, this would not follow the *Complete Binary Tree* property. 
2. To make sure we follow the *complete binary tree property* we need to add something at the position we removed the node. Only option is to add the last node. 
3. Now we are following the *complete binary tree* property but it might not follow *heap order* property.
4. `Heapify down` because we removed a node and swapped with the last node -> element we swapped to that position is definitely lesser than root node(map-heap).

43 --> 35
12 --> 6
12 --> 2

4 --> 1
```
