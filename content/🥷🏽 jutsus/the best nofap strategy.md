# the best nofap strategy

# Best Nofap Strategy

A problem I always have faced is that I can't maintain a long streak of nofap. One week, two week and then back to square one. In this video he shares to not concentrate on the streak, but concentrate on socialising, goals, fitness and relationships. 

He says about a research where, two rats were kept alone and one was given water and the other water laced with cocaine. The rat overdosed on the cocaine very quickly, but when he put a bunch of rats together in a rat park where they could socialise. When given water and water laced with cocaine none of them went for the cocaine and overdosed, all of them preferred water. 

We can say from the research that, rats that were lonely immediately overdosed themselves because they were lonely and had no purpose. While in the rat park since the rats didn't have this problem, they never overdosed on cocaine. 

He suggests to go out make friends, build relationships. While this can be one step, you should also find a skill that's gonna earn you money or help you in the future and also just concentrate on your fitness, eat healthy and by the end of the day you would have been satisfied and hence you would need to think of fapping.
