> Don't rush into falling in love, take your time to experience things, moments etc not only from the person you love but also in other aspects of your life.

The difference is the same difference as cramming for an exam and actually understanding the subject. 

When you are cramming you are just looking at the parts that would help you for the exam but not other parts but when you are trying to actually under stand a subject you spend time and try to understand things that you never would have if you ever just crammed it.

In fast love you confine this person in a box and if they change you start feeling uncomfortable to things like that but in slow love you get to see the box of this person grow and identify small things that never changed and those are the things that define this person for who they are.

We all like sugar and if we ever take it all the time over a long period of time it becomes sickening while you take small doses from time to time then you get to experience even other parts of life too.

Slow love is like a well balanced meal where you get to enjoy the sweet moments along with it fulfill your responsibilities and work on your ambitions etc. While fast love just takes too much out of your life.

If you want to get slow love then you should really be concentrating on other parts of your life and eventually the slow love you wanted will have been formed, grown and matured.
