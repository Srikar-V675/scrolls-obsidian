# Heaps Implementation

[[heaps]] can be easily implemented using [[linked list]] just like we do it for [[trees]], but there is another way that is prioritised i.e [[arrays]].

We can notice that [[heaps]] are partially sorted structures, they are not fully sorted like [[binary trees and binary search trees|binary search trees]] but are partially sorted. Since they are partially sorted and [[heaps]] are supposed to **complete binary trees** we can access the elements using maths.

```mermaid
graph TD;
a[i] --> b[2i + 1]
a[i] --> c[2i + 2]
```

**where,**
`i` -> index 

**Left child:**
$$2i + 1$$

**Right child:**
$$2i + 2$$

**Index of Parent Node:**
$$\lfloor \frac{i - 1}{2} \rfloor$$

**where below symbol is floor,**
$$\lfloor ...\rfloor$$

> [!important]-
> All of the above holds true for a `binary heap` but for a `k-heap` all the *2's* will be replaced with **k** simple as that.
