# Conceptual Notes

## Captures
 [00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=40&v=MYJsGksojms)
We care more about the information rather than the actual notes. 

[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=175&v=MYJsGksojms)
Do not write ever single thing that the resource you are learning from says or has mentioned, instead concentrate on understanding the concepts and evaluating them in your head, and trying to understand them. 

[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=192&v=MYJsGksojms)
Taking conceptual notes involves listening or reading the resource attentively and constantly evaluating whether the information presented to you (on a platter. :)) is *USE*.

> *USE:* Unimportant, Self Explanatory or Easy to Memorize

Lean on old stuff as support and don't forget them since most of the information you are consuming is one or the other way connected. *Link your notes*.

Everything in this world is not categorised into disciplines or domains as we do it, but they all are connected in one or the other way and lean more into one of the "domains". 

> Make sure to not limit your thoughts and link things.

The way your brain stores or remembers information is my taking concepts and linking them, then why do you need to take sequential notes and increase the stress. 

Instead link your notes as you are taking them, making sure you study less later and reorganise it again.
