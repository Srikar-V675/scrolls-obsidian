# Interview Rejections

## Summary
Don't feel dejected about [[Interv]], things go bad very often and often times they are not your mistake that was the reason. There can be several instances of why it went wrong but make sure you learn from your mistakes and rejections.

## Captures
Referrals may get you the interview but not the job offer, keep this in mind as long as you are applying for jobs. 

Make sure you are rested well before the [[Interv]], cause interviews at big tech companies can be exhausting. 

Sometime rejections can tell you the right field that you are suited to work for. Maybe you were not suited for mobile dev and that's the reason you got rejected. 

Take your rejections in a positive way, they can be saviours in disguise. As the writer of this blog experienced.
> He was rejected from a company and this company's stocks dropped 75% in the next 6 months. Hard Luck? ig yeah cause he dodges a bullet that could have given him some troubles.
