# empirical rule

**Source:** [[normal distribution]]

The Empirical Rule, also known as the `68-95-99.7 rule`, states that for a [[normal distribution]], approximately 68% of data points fall within one [[standard-deviation]] of the [[mean]], 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations. This rule helps in understanding the spread of data and identifying outliers in statistical analysis.
