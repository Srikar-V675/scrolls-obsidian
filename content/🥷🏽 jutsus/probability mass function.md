# Probability Mass Function

It is a function that gives the [[probability]] of a given set of [[discrete random variables]] taking on a particular value.

> [!example]+
> We know a dice has [[discrete random variables]] of: $$X = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$$
> Then the [[probability mass function]] would be: $$P(X == x)$$
