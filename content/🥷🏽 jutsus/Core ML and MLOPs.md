## Notes

#### Freelancing Gigs
After 4-6 weeks of learning based on your eligibility criteria mock interviews will be scheduled and if you are selected then you will be receiving gigs and earning. 

The interview will be 15-30 mins. If you are selected then you will be working under Ayush with any of the projects that he was given and after the project is done you would need to write a blog about it and the respective company that gave Ayush the job will pay you.

#### Advice
- Initially don't think about maximum output but try to put in your maximum input and expect only minimum input. This way the minimum output compounds to something so great that your life changes gradually.
