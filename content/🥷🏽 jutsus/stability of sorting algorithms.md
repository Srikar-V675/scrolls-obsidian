## Summary
Refers to whether the sorting algorithm follows the original ordering of elements in the data structure. 
> [!example]
> if we have two 4's in an array that is green and red, if the green comes before red in original array and this follows in the sorted array then it is Stable algorithm else Unstable algorithm.<br>
