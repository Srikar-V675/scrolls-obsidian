# Random Variables

Random variables are equal to sample space but are also not equal to sample space, because they are similar but different. The difference between sample space and random variables is that sample space only contains the `possible outcomes` of an experiment but random variables contains both the `possible outcomes` and their `probabiltiies`. 

#### Types
- [[discrete random variables]]
- [[continuous random variables]]
