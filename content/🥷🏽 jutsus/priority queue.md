# Priority Queue

A special type of [[queue]] where the higher number(or priority) element is dequeued first giving this [[queue]] a unique rule. Essentially when a new element is added the element is made sure to be moved to the right place in the queue order, while the opposite occurs for removal too(top of [[queue]] should always be highest priority element)

[[heap as priority queue]]
