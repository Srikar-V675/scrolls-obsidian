## 1. INPUT 

**For Books:**
1. `Grace` through the chapter once 
2. Look at the `quiz` at the end if any 
3. Look at only the `bolded` parts of the text. They are the headings and subheadings you need to know. 
4. Read the 1st and last sentence of each `para`.
5. Now read the whole chapter.

Doing it this way preps your brain by slowly letting it know what it is that we need to study and how to mind map them. 

This should work for any mode of input not only books, it could be recorded videos, lectures...

Make sure to remove any distractions around you and focus on only the task at hand, nothing else. 

## 2. OUTPUT

Use Multi Sensory Perception(MSP) i.e you try to use how many ever senses you can while learning so that it is rooted into your brain.

Hand write your notes. Only 20% of important stuff should be noted down not all.

Talk to yourself whatever you learned just talk not explain. 

Then explain the same thing to someone else or out loud to yourself `in your own words`.

## 3. REVIEW

Take absorption breaks, it is proven that when you are finished learning something you can take a nap and then wake up and revise the same thing you learnt, it works like a charm to retain your understanding of the concept. 

These naps can be 5-10 min power naps or even 10-30 secs of doing nothing(like literally nothing) and then you revise whatever you learned. 

> The confusion or difficulty you have when you are learning something new is actually your brain using its cognitive load to encode/learn the concept to be store in long term memory.
