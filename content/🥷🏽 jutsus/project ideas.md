## Build GPT
[Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out. - YouTube](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=aQM6e6ig9-471Pgc)

## LLM Twin
[LLM Twin GitHub](https://github.com/decodingml/llm-twin-course)
[LLM Twin Medium](https://medium.com/decodingml/an-end-to-end-framework-for-production-ready-llm-systems-by-building-your-llm-twin-2cc6bb01141f)
*Idea:* connect your obsidian notes too, which can add to a more comprehensive LLM Twin.

## F1 Projects
[GitHub - Jared-Chan/f1ml: Formula One Race Lap-by-Lap Prediction with Machine Learning](https://github.com/Jared-Chan/f1ml)
- Use the [OpenF1 API | Real-time and historical Formula 1 data](https://openf1.org/) because the API used in above project is deprecated. 

[GitHub - TomWebster98/Race-Strategy-Analysis: My personal project for F1 race strategy analysis and visualisations, including "What made the difference?" reports/blogs.](https://github.com/TomWebster98/Race-Strategy-Analysis)

[GitHub - chandanamulagund/Maximizing-Performance-Data-Analysis-of-Formula-1-Driver-and-Race-Data: Analysis of F1 races and their drivers](https://github.com/chandanamulagund/Maximizing-Performance-Data-Analysis-of-Formula-1-Driver-and-Race-Data)

[GitHub - ChintanTrivedi/football\_ai\_commentary: AI generating real-time football commentary](https://github.com/ChintanTrivedi/football_ai_commentary?)
- Check-out: [Live transcriptions of F1 races using Amazon Transcribe | AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/live-transcriptions-of-f1-races-using-amazon-transcribe/)

[GitHub - nesboonstra/f1\_xo\_project: Formula 1 Expected Overtakes Project](https://github.com/nesboonstra/f1_xo_project)
- Driver performance analysis plots based on above

## Build Your Own X
[Build Your Own X](https://build-your-own-x.vercel.app/)
[GitHub - codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x: Master programming by recreating your favorite technologies from scratch.](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)

## Ideas
Build a system where a given medium article link can be used to scrape and categorise it into pre defined categories by the user or maybe automatically too. 
- [GitHub - benthecoder/gpt3-blog-title: Using GPT-3 to help me get more üëè on medium.com](https://github.com/benthecoder/gpt3-blog-title?tab=readme-ov-file)

Percentage of news fakeness detection using RAG and news APIs

Flashcard generation using LLM or rag system for my obsidian vault. 

**Final Year Project Idea:** Build a system like Alexa and Jarwis that can work with tools and apps in your laptop and phone etc. Like an LLM voice agent. 

- Efficient blending of voice and background music which I noticed wasn't good in the medito app. The medito app had options to choose which background music you needed along with guide voice. I noticed that the blending was pretty good but was distinct probably because they were just playing both sounds and not blending it. We can have a light model that doesn't need much space so we can have less costs and run it on mobile phones. 
- forecasting model for your expense tracking. 

[ChatGPT - Obsidian LLM Knowledge Base](https://chatgpt.com/share/670e9c42-c04c-8013-b200-915723455902) this could be an excellent idea, spend some time refinign and building it.
