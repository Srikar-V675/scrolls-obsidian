# Expected Probability Values

It is the mean value of a [[probability]] distribution([[random variables]]) before any data is present(i.e before any experiment is done).

It represents the average result of many trials([[law of large numbers]]) of a random experiment.

**Formula:** $$\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{x} x P(X = x)$$

> [!important]+
> The [[expected probability values]] in [[law of large numbers]] comes from this value itself. Why does [[law of large numbers]] hold true? A: as you increase the number of experiments, the chances of each possible value occurring equally becomes high and hence average value -> expected value.

The above image tells us how [[law of large numbers]] holds true when the there equal occurrences of outcomes of a experiment(high likely to occur when experiment size is large)
