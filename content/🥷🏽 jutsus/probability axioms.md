# Probability Axioms

Axioms are some assumptions that are made during the formulation of an idea and come to be common sense or true. The axioms for [[probability]] include:
1. Non-negativity -> $$P(A)\ >=\ 0$$ can never be <= 0
2. Additivity -> for any [[disjoint sets]] A and B -> $$P(A \cup B) = P(A)\ +\ P(B)$$
3. Normalisation -> Sum of [[probability]] of all events -> $$1$$
