# Chaining

### Summary
Chaining is a ==collision resolution tactic== used in [[hash tables]]. It is a ==closed addressing tactic==. Unlike [[linear probing]] which utilises the other buckets if there is a collision, chaining ==implements a [[Linked List]] at the collision bucket to store the collisions==.

When there is a collision with the bucket computed by the [[hash functions]], this method uses a [[Linked List]] at the collision bucket to store the collision values.

### Problems 
*Linear Search Time:* if most of the values belong to a single bucket then the ==search for a value becomes equal to or close to linear time==, which defeats the reason of having a [[hash tables]]

Use *chaining* when we have a ==well-defined [[hash functions]] that distributes the values uniformly== making the search time average out to constant time.
