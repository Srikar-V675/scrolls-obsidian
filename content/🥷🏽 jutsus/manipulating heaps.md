# Manipulating Heaps

The whole point of a data structure is to be capable of adding and removing data into or from it. 

Since [[heaps]] follow a set of rules or properties that must always be true, we will be having the need to manipulate the structure to make sure we follow the rules. 

This is usually done by swapping nodes by checking the rules and ensuring the shape of the [[heaps]].

> We must always maintain the shape and structure of a [[heaps]] - otherwise it is violating one of it's properties.
