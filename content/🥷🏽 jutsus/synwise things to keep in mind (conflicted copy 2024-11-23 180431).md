# synwise things to keep in mind

**PROJECT:** [[SyncWise]]

- as soon as you create an instance of `Batch` instances of all 8 `Semester` must be created automatically.
- `teacher` user can only see sections to which she is class teacher. (useful when creating students for that section)
- add global `logging` of info.
