## Reflections
It was a fucking fun day(and tiring). It was MAD week and we had celebrations and stuff for the kids and the O9 company people that attended. Things didn't go as planned but we and the kids had fun and that was what we wanted. Met Kowsheka(hope the spelling is right) again today after a long time. It's somehow easier to talk to her than many other women. Had a good time talking to her and getting close. Texted her personally(I thought I would be a creep) but well I don't know what's in store. Today I guess I realised I can talk to people the problem here is I can't talk to them in such a way that they you know start to think of me as someone they can be friends with or you know like just something clicks and things go well, I don't see that happening with me. Maybe it's got something to do with me more than with the latter person.
