## Grateful for
The wonderla trip with friends. It was a good day, had loads of fun and was a good break. 

Having such good friends.

## Today's Learnings
Family comes first before friends. Like the situation that happened today with shasha, I was thinking back and forth to ask him to go by bus and let kishan be ignired because I had to drop him. But shahshanth was like you go alone I have some work at hsr(his sister's place). So yes family is first, dont put your friends first.

Do not try to be a person that's hung up on the past things, just get over it. Not good for your mind and health.
