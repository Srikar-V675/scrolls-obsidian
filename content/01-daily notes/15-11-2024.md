## Reflections
Shasha's bday today. things went pretty well, I think he was happy about it, since it would be his last bday with us. I just feel grateful for talking to Kowsheka cause I don;t think so it was a bad choice. I don't seem to like her but she really is someone who is easy to talk to, especially for someone like me. MAD classes went pretty well I didn't socialise much due to the fact that I didn't want to. I think I still haven't sorted out what I was feeling yesterday, I bet it would come back running to me again someday. I should deal with that.
