### Tasks


### Grateful for
getting requests for scraping the results cause I'm able identify some errors that were overlooked.

trying to make everything I do productive and helpful

making an effort to read after a long time.

### Today's Learnings
I gained some insights about learning machine learning from a yt video that had a compilation of ML advice by geniuses in the field. I still have to distill my thoughts around it, but the main idea was to make sure you learn not by theory but by implementing. Read research papers often.

I was looking into the optimal solution of the question that was asked for the [[ZopSmart]] interview, If I was less tensed and concentrated on the problem a little I could've arrived at the optimal solution.

I should have written unit tests for all the modules or functions in *EduInsights*, cause every time I scrape results for a new batch or semester I come across some or the other *silly* errors not major.
