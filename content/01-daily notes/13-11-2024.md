## Reflections
There's really something wrong with me dude. I feel so demotivated and moody ever since I started talking to Kowsheka. I didn't have any girls to talk to ever since me and trupthi got into a fight or rather things went bad because of **me**. Is that why since I have someone that really resonates with me to talk to that I've become like this? I don't understand it. Why am I such a mess? Whenever I try to get back on track something has to happen like this. Where did my discipline go? I know I did something, I didn't just simple slack off but still I'm not satisfied.
