## Reflections
I'm again watching p*** from time to time like an idiot. I get these urges if I'm awake after 11 or 12 because I'm tired and just want some refreshment -> turns out to be its always p***. 

No wonder you are not progressing in life, because of all the breaks you took you fucked up your schedule and your mind like an idiot. Winter Arc my ass. Restart all these shit, no more leaving p*** for 1 week or 2 week, your whole fucking life -> no more fucking p***.
