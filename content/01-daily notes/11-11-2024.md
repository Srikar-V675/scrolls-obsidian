## Reflections
I feel alone, I just want to be hugged by someone dude. Why the fuck do I feel like this? I feel exhausted even though I slept in the noon. It was pretty much a good day except for the fact that Trupthi won't hop on my bike and I've completely become someone that is insignificant to her. I know it was my mistake and I know I messed up real bad but I don't deserve to be treated like this man. Am I that bad of a person? Am I really that creepy. why is there this constant question in my mind that if I will ever get a partner in my life. I'm fucking 21 years old and I haven't had one relationship. Ig I'm just ranting without knowing the solution to this. I can talk to people but how do I impress them, how do I even like someone?
