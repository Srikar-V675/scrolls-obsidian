## Reflections
Somehow nothing goes as planned lately, is it me or just the things around me. I have planned to just go with the flow, if something happens don;t fight just go on. I was listening to tamil romance songs while coming back home, I feel lonely. I keep asking the same question that is what is it like to love someone? What is it even like to hug a woman dude like a passionate one? Why am I like this? Will I ever find the one or at least find one and lose her to start my character development arc(just kidding). That's all for today.
