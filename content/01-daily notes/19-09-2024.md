### Grateful for
The hard work that I put in, I think its paying off. I got the confirmation from *Accenture*

trying to juggle everything and manage my time.

spending time in building my personal knowledge management.

### Today's Learnings
Finished the *Cognizant* technical round, it went pretty well and for which I revised the SQL Queries etc.

I learnt [[DB Normalization]], [[acid properties in dbms]], [[joins in sql]], OS concepts etc for the [[ZopSmart]] technical round tomorrow.

I also learnt some coding Qs that were related to trees that was asked to some people previously.
