## Thoughts
Was a good day, usually Friday's are good if we have MAD classes. I have fun talking to new guys you know a little change in pace. We had some good laughs today. I saw Niharika, she looks pretty, but what am I doing? I just look at these women think yeah she looks pretty and stuff and then there is this brief motivation to talk to her(i mean text her) and then I just brush it off after remembering what happened with Trupthi.

What is it like to fall in love? Idk, I've never been in love, maybe I had crushes on a lot of women but love? I don't think so. What is it like to just love a women? Will I ever get to love someone, spend time with her and maybe marry her? Will that ever happen. I keep getting these thoughts that maybe I won't, I've come to the conclusion after the thing with vignesh getting chosen for fellow and the GenAI hackathon project thingy and then what my mom has told.
