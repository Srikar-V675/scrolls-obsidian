## Reflections
- you piece of shit..
- just stop doing it man, it makes you feel like shit and you still do it.
- don't you want to have kids?
- don't you want to sleep more?
- don't you want your brain to experience pleasure through something else and not this?
- your life is going to be better if you don't do it trust me.
- don't be like the 99.99% of people be the 1% or at least strive to be.
