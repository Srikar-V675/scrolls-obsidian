### Tasks

### Grateful for
all the time I'm putting to improve myself that directly helps improve my skills. I've been able to stay of my phone, shorts, reels etc. Lately I started deep work rather than pomodoro. It's been working well.

Organising my tasks trying to be humble, Ig I'm not a humble person according to my mom. I'm some weird fuck with some issues, I've heard that so many times that I have started believe it. 

### Today's Learnings
While setting up some files for project documentation I remembered I can use mermaid for db schemas, graphs and flowcharts.

Started [[learning vim shortcuts]] to switch to NeoVim. 

Finished [[trees]] essential questions and am increasing my understanding about trees and how to solve problems related to them.
