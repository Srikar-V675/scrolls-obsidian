## Grateful for
making myself productive, consuming content that is more useful to me than just dopamine giving vids.
trying to manage time, be more responsible, be mindful.

## Today's Learnings
I'm surely moving out of this obsidian ecosystem and workflow to emacs or neovim or doom emacs, whatever it is that I'm gonna use in my linux boot. 

One day I want to be using only Non-commercial open source s/w or apps. And fully transition to linux. I can see that I'm highly motivated to spend some time and learn vim, terminal and linux. 

Instead of using bloatware I want to use something very simple even if it is on the terminal and this something doesn't distract me.
