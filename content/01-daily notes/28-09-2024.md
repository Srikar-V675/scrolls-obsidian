## Tasks

## Grateful for
the technology I have to support what I'm trying to do.

following the 10-min rule for learning that I learnt in [[Learn something in 10 mins]].

## Today's Learnings
Perplexity is a fucking powerful tool since the information is usually grounded from sources on the internet. I can use it for learning, search, info etc.

[[mermaid diagrams docs |Mermaid diagrams]] are helpful for trees, graphs and er-diagram. New thing I got to know was mind maps is also possible and this helps me for implementing [[Learn something in 10 mins]].

## Thoughts 
Today I did it again(‚ùå) I was pretty much confident that I could do it and I was doing well. But suddenly on the 10th day of my streak I had thoughts, urges during the day, I controlled myself because I had coaching but in the night as I slept late the urge creeped in. 

I think the trigger really is sleeping late. I should be mindful of it.
