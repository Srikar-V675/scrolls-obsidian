## Thoughts
My mom kept telling I don't talk with respect when I'm speaking to her, but I never noticed that. But today she told `I can't kai thuri` and I wanted to reply `nange agutho ilvo antha nin heng helthya` but I replied `nange agutho ilvo antha nin yar heloke` which was disrespectful. I've been controlling my talking because I talk before thinking. I hope I'll improve on that.
