## Reflections
Woke up late again, missed gym. I just can't get my day to finish at 9 or something. Today too I'm writing this at 10:23 pm. I'm having issues with concentrating when I have this new Linux system that I'm so interested in customising and optimising. I should get out of that habit. It's been over a month and I'm still tweaking shit. I want to become better, I want to do so many things but how can I manage them. Isn't it bad to do multiple things at once? Cause you don't have that push and the startup time gets messed.
