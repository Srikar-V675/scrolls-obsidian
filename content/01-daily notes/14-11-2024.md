## Reflections
Had a very fucking bad day, I just wanna hug someone. I feel lonely, i feel like do I even deserve to be talking normally like this with Kowsheka. Do I really deserve to be treated nicely like that. I thought I sent a creepy text and I deleted because I got scared that I would stop hearing from her. But she saw and texted back like why did you delete? do you want to meet me or not... I felt happy dude like really happy after a long time there is someone(girl) that I really get along with, I really hope I don't mess up. I cried while I was getting dressed I was pissed, I was messed up this morning, everything just irritated me. One mess of a day, but I slowly getting back on track compared to yesterday. I really hope that things go well in my life from now on, I hope whatever that has happened in my life until now is just forgotten like the bad times. All these days I didn't have any girl I talked to I thought I just deserved after what I did to Trupthi but lately I'm starting to think do I really deserve to think like that.
