## Today's Learning  
From the events today what I learnt was that I should concentrate on whatever I am doing right now and nothing in the past and nothing in the future. Put your 100% in the present.

## Reflections
I have noticed this for a long time, if I make a new girl [space] friend I keep thinking about these fake scenarios in my mind, pretty much all the time that's the problem. Sometimes they just go haywire and don't make sense much. I should stop doing that and be mindful of these kind of things, I wouldn't going to a good place if this continues. I wonder if I'll ever be successful in my life. I want to be that person in my family that broke out of the barrier. I'll keep hustling, it's not the end of the world anyway. 

It was a fucking tiring day, I had coaching from 12pm-5pm and I was continuously standing man I'm exhausted. But I tried keep my mind there and actually concentrate on teaching. I saw that Anay was actually a good player(which I hadn't realised until today like an idiot).
