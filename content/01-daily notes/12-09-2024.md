### Grateful for


### Today's Learnings
- started with the challenge-2 of ai-devs challenge by LangFlow.
- looking for final year project ideas.

### Reflections
- did it again. I've improved my mindfulness by meditating on the Atom app but I still can't stop from doing these bad habits.
- good habits give us late gratification or results and are unharmful on the long run
- bad habits give us instant gratification and are harmful on the long run
- the next time you get the thought or you are doing it, remind this to yourself and try to stop.
