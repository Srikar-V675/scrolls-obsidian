### Tasks

### Grateful for
getting the interview opportunity at [[ZopSmart]], don't know if I'll get selected.

### Today's Learnings
My CS fundamentals and basics is fucked, idk anything in deep. Should improve my problem-solving skills, handling pressure in interviews. 

Should improve the way I explain my approach when solving a DSA question. Attend mock interviews, conduct mock interviews with vikki.

Basics of [[trees]], [[binary trees and binary search trees]]. Should learn traversal and solving leetcode Qs.
