## Tasks

## Grateful for
the mock-interview because I learnt something.

the patience I'm having lately.

## Today's Learnings
I had the first mock-interview with vikki today. It went pretty well except the fact that I didn't consider an edge case in the problem. But it was a good thing we did the mock-interview. refer to: [[134. Gas Station ⛽️]]. You should try to see edge cases and think broad don't stick on a thing and make things awkward because that's how vikki felt.

Open-Source Contributions is giving me some problems because I'm unable to decide which issue and which repo to contribute to and I can't understand a word in those issues.
