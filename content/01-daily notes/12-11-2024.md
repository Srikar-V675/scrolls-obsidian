## Reflections
I messed up and made a bad remark on Vignesh he got kind of pissed and told me don't talk like that again. I was at mistake for sure and I know that I blurt out some bad things from my mouth I need to correct that. Ever since this week started and I'm taking cold showers I'm feeling fucking tired and demotivated af. Didn't get shit done today, bare time pass. Tomorrow me start, get serious bitch. Fear that if you stay like this in your comfort zone you will never become what you want to be one day. Push yourself.
