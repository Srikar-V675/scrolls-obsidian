## Today's Learnings 
The LLM Twin course was a bad choice for the hackathon, because the documentation isn't right and also doesn't explain how to setup the cloud environments rightly. 

I went with implementing a similar thing but with using my obsidian notes as the source for RAG. 

## Reflections
I always choose ones that are flashy and is hard to implement as in projects. I feel like my ideas aren't any unique but just imitations of what I've seen online. 

I'm starting to revert back to old anxious self, whose heart was always pounding. I must figure out a way to get rid of it.
