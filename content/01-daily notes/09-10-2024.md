## Today's Learnings
I'm slowly going back to my old self, being unproductive, watching p***, etc. This is not right, this is not what I'm supposed to be, I want to change. I have changed in some aspects but still I'm getting back to my old habits of:
1. using my phone more. 
2. not being disciplined about my studies.
3. if something bad happens, I just don't do anything that day. 
4. I'm slowly moving towards un-productivity and [[Fast Women and Slow Horses]] is killing me. 

Here's what I need to do:
1. get your shit back together.
2. maintain discipline even though things go bad.
3. make learning addictive. 
4. make trying things that you are not comfortable with a habit.
5. Do not watch yt once you are in bed.
6. make sure to not over plan your day.
7. Just fucking do deep work.
