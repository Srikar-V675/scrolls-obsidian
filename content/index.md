> My name is Srikar V. I have always been a fan of these digital gardens, blogs I see online all beautifully structured and done. And to my shocking they were most of the time obsidian vaults. It always wondered me how they did it, and then I came across [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and [Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) which can help you render your obsidian notes as a static website. I was using Digital Garden which had good features, it could even render excalidraw drawings, mermaid etc, but I didn't like the UI, it was not to my taste. Even though it was the easiest to setup I didn't like it. So recently I moved to Quartz and damn it is good. If you are reading this then you are on the website rendered using Quartz. I have called it `Scrolls` because of the reference to Naruto where scrolls hold a lot of `Jutsus`.
